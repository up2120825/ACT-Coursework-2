in my notebooks, I use matplotlib and seaborn for plotting, numpy and pandas for data manipulation, sklearn for various machine learning techniques, and tensorflow for neural networks 


import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score, KFold
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
from sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder
from sklearn.utils import class_weight
import tensorflow as tf

# ACT-Coursework-2
This github repository contains my coursework solutions for ACT Course Work 2

It includes 3 folders, one for each question 1, 2 and 3, containing a python jupyter notebook, containing my code, the outputs, and markdown text to style it like a "medium" article

These 3 notebooks are based on a dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karnikakapoor/satellite-orbital-catalog that contains satellite data

I use this to predict congestion risk in question 1 using a random forest classifier, and in part 2 using a neural network

The third notebook i explore how do choice about data such as the amount of training data and balance of classes in aclassification problem affect the performance of a neural network
